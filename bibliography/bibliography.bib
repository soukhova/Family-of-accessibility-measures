	abstract = {Transportation systems around the world have been designed in a way that emphasizes the pre-eminence of motorized mobility, in particular the private car. This has led to the emergence of transportation monocultures, deﬁned as systems where the ability of travelers to use various modes is constrained. In order to create transportation polycultures, alternative modes of transportation must be available and users must perceive them as feasible alternatives to the car. This implies changing the modality style (a predisposition towards certain modes) and increasing the modality (number of alternatives available and feasible for use) of travelers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the modality of respondents to a travel survey in McMaster University, Canada. We deﬁne modality as the self-reported number of modes that respondents consider available/feasible for their daily commute, including the chosen mode. Analysis is based on the application of an ordered probit model. The results of our study indicate that modality is inﬂuenced by a combination of demographic, attitudinal and spatial/land use variables. With respect to mode of travel, active travelers tend to have a higher modality compared to users of motorized modes. Car users who live in more densely built environments are more likely to report higher levels of modality, whereas density reduces the modality of users of local transit. Distance from McMaster reduces the modality of car and local transit users.},

Possible sites for centers are selected on general planning grounds and tested for feasibility and “balance.” Balance is determined in terms of the volume of business attracted by each center in relation to its size. By repeated trials, it is established that there exists a balanced distribution in which the size of centers is related to their drawing power, which in turn depends on the distribution of purchasing power projected for the area and the transportation facilities and for trip-makers. This land use model is intimately related to transportation models, by The balanced distribution of retail outlets turns out to be the minimum cost pattern for trip-makers. This land use model is intimately related to transportation models, by way of network tracing and a gravity model trip distribution theory. It represents a departure from some of the restrictions of central place theory (as illustrated in the article by Berry in this issue).},

   abstract = {AbstractAccessibility planning is a crucial alternative to mobility planning for reaching sustainable outcomes. Although there is a vast literature on accessibility, less attention is paid to accessibility as a relative concept, i.e., its relationship with the socio-economic characteristic of the population. While accessibility is known to vary by location, it also changes as a consequence of differences in individual willingness to reach destinations by certain transport modes. Using the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study, this paper evaluates relative non-motorized accessibility (walking and cycling) to three types of retail activities: daily, weekly, and incidental. First, a clustering process is used to identify four population groups according to their socio-economic characteristics (the young employed; the young unemployed; seniors and adults). Second, distance-decay functions based on time-willingness to reach retail destinations by non-motorized modes are compared between the four clusters of population. Third, relative accessibility maps based on gravity-based models are elaborated, highlighting places that exhibit statistical differences between the population clusters. The results indicate that willingness to reach retail stores on foot by seniors (>65?years old) was significantly different from the rest of groups analyzed, providing additional insights on how relative accessibility measurements can anticipate potential social exclusion risks.},

In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation.},

   abstract = {We put forward a method for measuring the social interaction potential of a metropolitan region based on the time-geographic concept of joint accessibility. The metric is sensitive to prevailing land use patterns and commuter flows in the metropolitan region, time budgets, and the spatial distribution of joint activity locations. It is calculated via a geocomputation routine in which a representative subset of after-work, spacetime prisms are intersected with each other. Decomposition of the metric gives rise to social potential metrics for each employment and residential zone in the city, for specific commuter flows, and for locations of potential social interaction, such as bars, restaurants, sports fields, and so on. The method is demonstrated via a scenario-based experiment that explores the impact of residential and employment land use patterns and varying levels of commuter flow dispersion. The findings indicate that the metric is adequately responsive to each of the scenario input parameters, as well as pairwise combinations of parameters. Following the experiment, an empirical example using flow data from Salt Lake City, Utah, is presented. Insights on how to introduce more realism in the calculation of the metric for actual metropolitan regions for comparative purposes are then put forward. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of the broader applications of this metric to various topical areas in urban geography including segregation, social capital development, innovation and creativity, and location allocation of facilities and their opening hours.},

	abstract = {In the 1970s, spatial autocorrelation (i.e., local distance and configuration effects) and distance decay (i.e., global distance effects) were suspected of being intermingled in spatial interaction model specifications. This convolution was first treated in a theoretical context by Curry (1972), with some subsequent debate (e.g., Curry, Griffith, and Sheppard 1975). This work was followed by a documentation of the convolution (e.g., Griffith and Jones 1980) and further theoretical treatment of the role spatial autocorrelation plays in spatial interaction modeling (e.g., Griffith 1982). But methodology did not exist at the time—or even soon thereafter—to easily or fully address spatial autocorrelation effects within spatial interaction model specifications, a contention attested to and demonstrated by the cumbersome and difficult-to-implement techniques employed by, for example, Bolduc, Laferrière, and Santarossa (1992, 1995) and Bolduc, Fortin, and Gordon (1997). Today, however, eigenfunction-based spatial filtering offers a methodology that can account for spatial autocorrelation effects within a spatial interaction model. This paper updates work from the early 1980s, extending it with spatial filtering methods.},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the eﬀort for calculations and the diﬃculty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or landuse and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual’s spatial–temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user beneﬁts, and the measurement of diﬀerent components of accessibility.},

In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities, and by travel mode.},

The myriad of distinct but familially related access measures created many more options to measure places, but has sown needless confusion. This paper systematically reviews measures of access across disciplines. We categorize measures of access, covering both mainstream and innovative but less widely-used techniques; each access measure (topological, contiguous, cumulative opportunities, utility, flow-based measures) is separated into Primal and Dual measure, based on whether accessibility is represented by the level of reachable opportunities or by the travel impedance. We show access measures are unified by the same intrinsic structure consisting of travel impedance and the opportunities reachable, and that access measured by different methods are equivalent under specific assumptions on travel impedance, and the accounting of relevant opportunities. This paper overviews the use of access measures from the existing literature, and clarifies measures of access, which should help users in the selection and appropriate use of access measures for the relevant context.},

However, the influences of accessibility on regional economies are understudied. This study investigated changes in accessibility between urban areas and ice-snow tourist destinations after implementation of high-speed rail in northeastern China. Data on transportation networks, destinations, and economic factors were used to compute weighted mean travel times and daily accessibility, and a tourism-economy linkage model was utilized. After implementation, (1) the shortest intercity travel times were significantly shorter, (2) numbers of one-day and weekend trips significantly increased, (3) distribution of accessible tourist destinations expanded northward and southward, (4) isochrone analysis revealed that central cities promoted tourism development in nearby cities, and (5) intercity tourism-economy linkages increased. Accessibility to Shenyang was the most powerful influence on economic development. The tourism-economy linkages between Liaoyang and other cities were greatly enhanced between 2008 and 2018.},

   abstract = {As accessibility becomes an increasingly relevant concept in the analysis of sustainable transport and urban development, the accuracy of accessibility measures becomes increasingly vital. While more complex measures are gradually gaining popularity with increasing data and computational resources, policy makers and planners are still prone to opt for less complex methods that are easy to use and interpret. The cumulative opportunities measure is the most widely applied accessibility measure in planning practice, but it is also among the least accurate due to its lack of consideration of the impact of competition for those opportunities. This study seeks to highlight the impact of addressing competition for different urban services in the cumulative opportunities measure. A competition component is added to the measure, which is applied to a case study of three types of urban services in the Perth metropolitan area; health, primary/secondary education and shopping. The results show that considering competition changes the spatial patterns of accessibility and its equity. Since this approach reveals demand-supply imbalances, it can more accurately determine spatial inequalities in accessibility, and hence increases the utility of the cumulative opportunities measure. We also find that the three services had varying levels and spatial patterns of accessibility and spatial equity, thus relying on any single one of them for assessing spatial structural performance can be misleading.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies investigate the topic of industrial agglomeration, and in particular of localization economies that give rise to patterns of geographical clustering of firms. These studies have employed different indicators useful to assess a sector's degree of geographic clustering, or to characterize the nature of the scale on which localization occurs. However, less work has been conducted to identify significant clustering of industrial activity at the sub-regional level. The objective of this study is to investigate the spatial clustering of high-tech and knowledge-intensive firms in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. We do this by means of the use of a spatial scan statistic. Application of this statistic leads us to conjecture that accessibility to transportation infrastructure and skilled labour contribute to the formation of industrial clusters in these sectors. Our conjecture is borne by a set of logit models that identify these two factors as significantly contributing to cluster membership.},

However, creating a flexible and responsive transportation system will require more coordination and cooperation across a variety of spatial scales and time horizons than is evident in our current, competitive systems.

   abstract = {Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

New technologies that provide information about various modes and environments can help to inform choices regarding travel and accessibility. In this paper we describe the development of a web-based accessibility calculator prototype for the Greater Montreal Area in Canada. The core of this tool is a statistical model of trip length developed using the spatial expansion method. The model is used to obtain estimates of trip length for a desired profile, based on attributes such as age, gender, family structure, and mode of travel, as well as geographical location. These estimates are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities accessibility measure to different types of essential destinations. Travel behavior information is drawn from Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys. Geocoded information about trip origins and destinations is used to calculate trip length. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes, and urban form are used. A geocoded business point database is used for the calculation of cumulative opportunities. To simplify the use of the accessibility calculator, the model is implemented in a user-friendly way using Google Maps API v3 and a convenient interface. Different possible uses of the accessibility calculator are illustrated in the paper. The accessibility calculator can be used by members of the public or planners/policy makers to measure the level of accessibility for a specific address and personal profile by various modes of transportation.

Despite its widespread use, few measurement options allow for the comparison of accessibility across multiple urban systems, and most do not adequately control for market competition between demand-side actors and supply-side facilities in localized markets. In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities, and by travel mode.},

However, in practice, most transport planning processes are focused on improving mobility and not on improving accessibility. Recent research has made it clear that what is blocking the accessibility approach are not the technological dimensions of transport planning, or the lack of knowledge about how to perform accessibility planning in practice. This approach is being blocked instead by institutional barriers. This article critically identiﬁes some of these barriers. Adopting a cross-disciplinary and international perspective, two rounds of in-depth interviews with accessibility experts were conducted. This allowed gathering insights not only about the institutional barriers to the adoption of the accessibility approach in transport planning practice, but also about possible pathways to make accessibility a more central concept in decision-making.},

In this survey, we review the approaches developed to reproduce various mobility patterns, with the main focus on recent developments. This review can be used both as an introduction to the fundamental modeling principles of human mobility, and as a collection of technical methods applicable to specific mobilityrelated problems. The review organizes the subject by differentiating between individual and population mobility and also between short-range and long-range mobility.

The analysis of research results in the field of mass transit reveals an explicit similarity between {TLD} in different cities and the gamma distribution. It points to general regularities in various systems of mass transit that lead to the similarity in {TLD}. The regularities are determined by studying the spatial distribution of mass transit stops, which are considered trip origins and destinations.

By employing the bibliometric analysis techniques, this study provides the potential to trace historical and geographic trends at global level, covering leading journals and institutions, keywords characteristics, citation network analysis, and a qualitative review of the most inﬂuential papers. The output results show that there is an increasing geographic spread along with the growth spurt of research publications on the topic of accessibility especially since 2010s. Both the keywords' characteristics and citation network analysis help to identify research hot points, categorized as new indicators development and accessibility-based applications. Finally, this paper highlights the need for further studies for those two hot points respectively. It is hoped the results output here could beneﬁt researchers engaging in this ﬁeld to sharpen their own future research directions, and provide practitioners with a greater understanding of the various types of accessibility metrics and help them to identify the most appropriate practice for their speciﬁc situation.},

Results show that car ownership and educational attainment significantly increased the odds that someone switched from welfare to work, while transit service quality variables were largely insignificant. Nor was regional accessibility important in explaining employment outcomes, a finding that casts doubt on the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Concentration of housing near bus and rail routes appeared most important in stimulating employment. However, improved automobility had far stronger effects on employment outcomes than improvements in transit mobility.},

	abstract = {The inequitable geographic distribution of health care resources has long been recognized as a problem in the United States. Traditional measures, such as a simple ratio of supply to demand in an area or distance to the closest provider, are easy measures for spatial accessibility. However the former one does not consider interactions between patients and providers across administrative borders and the latter does not account for the demand side, that is, the competition for the supply. With advancements in GIS, however, better measures of geographic accessibility, variants of a gravity model, have been applied. Among them are (1) a two-step ﬂoating catchment area (2SFCA) method and (2) a kernel density (KD) method. This microscopic study compared these two GIS-based measures of accessibility in our case study of dialysis service centers in Chicago. Our comparison study found a signiﬁcant mismatch of the accessibility ratios between the two methods. Overall, the 2SFCA method produced better accessibility ratios. There is room for further improvement of the 2SFCA method—varying the radius of service area according to the type of provider or the type of neighborhood and determining the appropriate weight equation form—still warrant further study.},

	abstract = {Spatial accessibility to kindergartens is a critical issue related to the transport safety of children. Young children should be escorted to kindergartens by adults, and trips to kindergartens are occasionally dependent on parents’ home–work trips because parents may escort their children to kindergartens en route to work. Many types of school trip can be categorized into two main types: “Home–School” and “Home–School–Work” trips. However, existing studies have tended to focus on only one type of school trip and have disregarded the other type in the assessment of accessibility. The present study examines accessibility to kindergartens by considering both types of school trips. The basic two-step floating catchment area method is used to measure the accessibility of “Home–School” trips and the commuter-based two-step floating catchment area is used for “Home–School–Work” trips. This study proposes a spectrum combinational approach, which combines both types of trips according to their actual percentages, to provide a realistic assessment of accessibility to kindergartens. An empirical study is conducted in Shanghai by combining cellphone big data and traditional data from a census. Results indicate that, compared with the spectrum combinational approach, the inequality of accessibility would be underestimated if we only focus on “Home–School” trips in the measurement of accessibility, but overestimated if we only focus on “Home–School–Work” trips. The proposed spectrum combinational approach, by modifying the trip assumptions on which accessibility evaluation is based, constitutes a novel and more realistic accessibility measurement of spatial accessibility to kindergartens.},

First, the proposed method considers the interaction between the food supply (in terms of categorized benefit redemptions) and demand (in terms of benefit-receiving households). Second, the model is used to visualize food access patterns at the level of refined administrative units (i.e., census block groups). The developed food access metric was compared to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Access Research Atlas, justifying the validity of this new method for small area estimation. The following are important observations: (1) the choice of catchment size had a considerable impact on the accessibility measure in urban areas (or when small statistical units are used); (2) the 2SFCA measurement had a higher level of correspondence with that of the USDA Atlas at a smaller catchment size for identifying low food access units; and (3) there was no significant inequality regarding SNAP accessibility with respect to different socioeconomic deprivation variables. This new method can better assist the SNAP administration with store authorization on a refined geographic scale.},

	abstract = {Most existing healthcare accessibility studies ignore the travel time uncertainty that are commonly encountered in road networks. This study aims to examine the impacts of travel time uncertainty on healthcare accessibility. A reliability-based two-step ﬂoating catchment area (2SFCA) method is proposed to evaluate healthcare accessibility under travel time uncertainty. The proposed measure generalizes the conventional 2SFCA measure by explicitly considering individuals' reliability constraints when scheduling visits to healthcare facilities in the face of travel time uncertainty. The proposed measure is further used to investigate travel time uncertainty impacts in a comprehensive case study. A big dataset of taxi trajectories is collected in the case study to extract dynamic information on travel time distributions. The results of the case study highlight the signiﬁcant but heterogeneous impacts of travel time uncertainty on healthcare accessibility for various parts of the city at diﬀerent times of the day. They also have several methodological implications for the evaluation of healthcare accessibility under travel time uncertainty.},

We conclude that technological developments result in a much greater improvement in accessibility than demographic and infrastructural change. This is already visible with the 30 to 60 min isochrones, in particular when using the BMW in Cracow (with a more than 36\% improvement in accessibility). Even greater changes, reaching as much as over 90\%, are observed for the 60–90 min isochrones. The analysis shows that the shift in electromobility may be constrained by parallel demographic processes, dispersion of population in suburban areas, and the development of road infrastructure. The novelty of the approach stems from the fact that it is based on three above mentioned key factors that influence the accessibility of labor markets for EV users in the largest cities up to 2030.},

	abstract = {Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a deﬁned travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reﬂected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

Assessing it with gravity-based or potential accessibility measures requires the selection of an impedance function in order to reflect the friction of distance. The choice of impedance function is crucial to pedestrian accessibility assessment due to the level of spatial data detail required and also because perceived distances differ from physical distances. Here, we measure and compare 20 gravitybased measures, varying the impedance function and associated parameters. Correlation analysis revealed a significant and strong correlation between the measures. Factor analysis extracted two groups of measures, differing mainly in their maximum cutoff travel distance, i.e. the distance at which the impedance function reaches zero. Spatial analysis revealed that all measures produce similar spatial results in terms of identifying high and low accessibility locations but different values for medium accessibility locations. Places located at between 200 and 400 m from an opportunity are especially sensitive to the impedance function used. We promote a cumulative–Gaussian approach to measure pedestrian accessibility, as it explicitly includes the travel tolerance concept and we found it to be the most robust measure in terms of data variability.},

	abstract = {Accessibility plays a fundamental role in the transport network. In fact, accessibility may be used for investigating the (un)even distribution of economic activities, or the (dis)equilibrium in the development of different regional performances. In particular, accessibility analysis can be considered as a first exploratory step in the understanding of people's needs and behaviour, especially in the framework of transport network structures. From the methodological viewpoint, accessibility has a long tradition, starting in the 1950's with the pioneering work by Hansen, who defined accessibility as the potential of opportunity for interaction. Such a definition can also be considered as an integrated framework of all subsequent definitions. The aim of this paper is to explore accessibility in the German commuting network, by focusing attention on the relevance of the impedance form associated with it. The conventional (potential) accessibility function - in the light of the related economic activities - is used as a suitable instrument to identify the major German hub/attraction nodes. In this formulation, different types of decay functions are used as impedance forms. In our applications we consider home-to-work commuters travelling between 439 German districts, for both 2003 and 2007. We carry out a comparative analysis of the accessibility values in these years, by outlining the different emerging hierarchies, resulting from the use of different impedance forms. In addition, we explore which type of accessibility indicator best matches the connectivity network. The final aim is to identify - by means of different accessibility functions - homogeneous vs. heterogeneous characteristics of the German commuting network.},

Speciﬁcally, a Dirichlet multinomial regression topic model (DMR model) is applied to identify bicycle trajectories' trip purposes, simultaneously considering arrival time and drop-oﬀ location. Based on obtained trip purposes, we estimate impedance functions using a negative exponential function. Finally, based on estimated impedance functions, two cases of bicycle accessibility for two diﬀerent purposes - restaurant and hospital - are presented in Shanghais central area. The results show that almost 90\% of bicycle trips are less than 30 min or 5 km. Although the diﬀerence between the impedance functions between various trip purposes is not signiﬁcant, we ﬁnd that trip purposes of “Work and School” have the highest travel impedance for bicyclists. Cyclists in Shanghai accept longer bicycle travel times for leisure (e.g., shopping) than for commuting (e.g., work or school).},

	abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more “gender sensitive” and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

	abstract = {One of the most common applications of accessibility is in evaluating inequality in access to jobs. A vital factor to be incorporated by accessibility indicators when analyzing job accessibility is the competition for job positions by job seekers; otherwise, the results may be inaccurate or misleading. Despite efforts by researchers to develop accessibility measures that capture job competition, they fail to ensure that these measures are practical and easily interpretable and communicable, which in turn makes planners and policymakers continue to opt for more straightforward measures. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by providing a simple accessibility measure that accounts for competition effects, while remaining practical, intuitive, and highly communicable. The proposed indicator – Balancing Time – is applied to assess the inequality in job accessibility in 160 neighborhoods within the city of Rio de Janeiro, and the results are compared with the most popular indicator used in practice, the cumulative opportunities. The findings suggest that Balancing Time overcomes some of the limitations of cumulative opportunities and that it is a useful tool for planners, particularly in the cities with job opportunities concentrated in central areas. Given its simplicity, Balancing Time is especially relevant in the context of the Global South, where most transport agencies face data limitations and have low skilled technical staff.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of social impacts of transport policies has been attracting growing attention in recent years. Yet studies thus far have predominately focused on developed countries and overlooked whether equity assessment of transport projects is sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper investigates how investments in public transport can reshape socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities, and it examines how MAUP can influence the distributional effects of transport project evaluations. The study looks at Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and the transformations carried out in the city in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, which involved substantial expansion in public transport infrastructure followed by cuts in service levels. The paper uses before-and-after comparison of Rio's transport network (2014-2017) and quasi-counterfactual analysis to examine how those policies affect access to schools and jobs for different income groups and whether the results are robust when the data is analyzed at different spatial scales and zoning schemes. Results show that subsequent cuts in service levels have offset the accessibility benefits of transport investments in a way that particularly penalizes the poor, and that those investments alone would still have generated larger accessibility gains for higher-income groups. These findings suggest that, contrary to Brazil’s official discourse of transport legacy, recent policies in Rio have exacerbated rather than reduced socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities. The study also shows that MAUP can influence the equity assessment of transport projects, suggesting that this issue should be addressed in future research.},

   abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals’ response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.},

Measuring the spatial accessibility to urban parks serves as an initial step in urban planning and devel­ oping urban development strategies to improve social and environmental justice. This study aims to evaluate measures of spatial accessibility to urban parks by comparing three geographic information systems (GIS)-based approaches, accounting for network complexity, transport modes, distance thresholds, and destination choices. Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.},

   abstract = {Accessibility is a central concept in transport geography research that has been described as a holistic measure of transportation and land use systems. This concept has numerous implementations, but virtually all share the way accessibility is measured as an attribute of pairs of origins and destinations. Borrowing from concepts in network science, in this paper we propose a new centrality measure called betweenness-accessibility. This measure couples the familiar betweenness indicator of social networks with the geographical concept of accessibility. Betweenness-accessibility is useful to estimate the impacts of accessibility on networks as potential for interaction is reflected on them. The new measure is illustrated using a reproducible example. In addition, an application to vulnerability analysis in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, provides an empirical case study to showcase the usefulness of betweenness-accessibility.},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: A growing number of planning researchers and practitioners argue for a shift from mobility-centered transportation planning to an accessibility-focused one. Accessibility is a compelling concept that has proven more difficult to operationalize than mobility, which helps to explain why so many accessibility metrics have been developed for urban research and planning practice. To assess the state of these metrics, we reviewed 54 of them in light of their theoretical basis, data requirements, units of analysis, travel modes and trip purposes accounted for, and potential applications to planning practice. We also reviewed the substantial literature on accessibility measurement and interviewed planning practitioners who are applying accessibility metrics in practice. We find that accessibility theory and measurement has advanced more rapidly than applications in practice. However, a new generation of tools is emerging that may accelerate the move to accessibility planning. Although many of the measures focus on a single travel mode, the number of multimodal metrics is growing. Most of the measures are designed for regional-scale planning and scenario evaluation; only a few to date are intended for project evaluation. Takeaway for practice: The 54 accessibility metrics and tools we reviewed vary widely and none stands out as obviously superior for planning practice. Although most calculate the accessibility of places, and many do so reasonably well, we see the most promise in measures of the accessibility of travelers, which can then be aggregated for place-based analyses while still shedding light on how access can vary substantially across different types of travelers. The principal challenge to broadly deploying accessibility analyses in practice in the years ahead is in developing measures that meaningfully measure the many salient dimensions of access, have manageable data requirements, and are understandable to planners, public officials, and community members.},

   title = {Accessibility to health care facilities in Montreal Island: An application of relative accessibility indicators from the perspective of senior and non-senior residents},
   journal = {International Journal of Health Geographics},
   volume = {9},
   number = {52},
   pages = {1-9},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND:Geographical access to health care facilities is known to influence health services usage. As societies age, accessibility to health care becomes an increasingly acute public health concern. It is known that seniors tend to have lower mobility levels, and it is possible that this may negatively affect their ability to reach facilities and services. Therefore, it becomes important to examine the mobility situation of seniors vis-a-vis the spatial distribution of health care facilities, to identify areas where accessibility is low and interventions may be required.METHODS:Accessibility is implemented using a cumulative opportunities measure. Instead of assuming a fixed bandwidth (i.e. a distance threshold) for measuring accessibility, in this paper the bandwidth is defined using model-based estimates of average trip length. Average trip length is an all-purpose indicator of individual mobility and geographical reach. Adoption of a spatial modelling approach allows us to tailor these estimates of travel behaviour to specific locations and person profiles. Replacing a fixed bandwidth with these estimates permits us to calculate customized location- and person-based accessibility measures that allow inter-personal as well as geographical comparisons. Data The case study is Montreal Island. Geo-coded travel behaviour data, specifically average trip length, and relevant traveller's attributes are obtained from the Montreal Household Travel Survey. These data are complemented with information from the Census. Health care facilities, also geo-coded, are extracted from a comprehensive business point database. Health care facilities are selected based on Standard Industrial Classification codes 8011-21 (Medical Doctors and Dentists).RESULTS:Model-based estimates of average trip length show that travel behaviour varies widely across space. With the exception of seniors in the downtown area, older residents of Montreal Island tend to be significantly less mobile than people of other age cohorts. The combination of average trip length estimates with the spatial distribution of health care facilities indicates that despite being more mobile, suburban residents tend to have lower levels of accessibility compared to central city residents. The effect is more marked for seniors. Furthermore, the results indicate that accessibility calculated using a fixed bandwidth would produce patterns of exposure to health care facilities that would be difficult to achieve for suburban seniors given actual mobility patterns.CONCLUSIONS:The analysis shows large disparities in accessibility between seniors and non-seniors, between urban and suburban seniors, and between vehicle owning and non-owning seniors. This research was concerned with potential accessibility levels. Follow up research could consider the results reported here to select case studies of actual access and usage of health care facilities, and related health outcomes},

	abstract = {Job accessibility depends on the relationship between transport system and land uses. It involves competition for the same set of opportunities among users of various transport modes. This study introduces a multi-modal approach to investigate the impacts of public transport on job accessibility. It adapts the multi-modal two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method to measure job accessibility. It collects empirical data to operationalize the method in the context of Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen is chosen because of public transport accounts for a significant share of the city's commuting trips and the city is a pilot city for China's Transit Metropolis Strategy. Results show that job accessibility by public transport is much poorer and more unevenly distributed than that by driving car. The former reaches its minimum in the peripheral whereas the latter is relatively high in most areas. Results reveal significant disadvantages in accessing job opportunities for low-income or migrant workers who are dependent on public transport. The consideration of inter-modal competition would further strengthen such disadvantages. Considering that there is often correlation between job accessibility by public transport and social equity, this study illustrates transferable procedures and methods to quantify and visualize such accessibility and to identify spots where there is deficiency in the supply of such accessibility. It demonstrates the importance of incorporating the inter-modal competition into the evaluation of job accessibility in multi-modal contexts. It highlights land use and transport policy countermeasures to improve job accessibility by public transport.},

  abstract = {With the development of society, an increasing number of educational institutions have adopted field environmental education activities rather than classroom education. Field education can not only enhance students’ environmental awareness but also enable them to fully understand environmental protection knowledge. Ecological protection areas are important bases for educational institutions to organize students to implement field environmental education. Focusing on Zhuhai City, this study explored spatial relationships between educational institutions and ecological protection zones using Kernel density estimation, the two-step floating catchment area method, and Thiessen polygons. Specific actions included measuring transportation accessibility and dividing the service scopes of ecological protection zones to provide field environmental education for educational institutions. These actions provided a helpful reference for educational institutions to conduct field environmental education activities effectively. The results showed the following: (1) Schools in Zhuhai City were mainly located in subdistricts and presented a spatial layout of “one primary and two secondary.” Students were mainly concentrated in villages and towns and presented a spatial layout of “one core and two centers.” Ecological protection zones were scattered in the township area; their spatial relationships with educational institutions were scattered. Meanwhile, their spatial relationship with the number of students was relatively concentrated. (2) In terms of the accessibility of educational institutions to ecological protection zones, the educational institutions in the northeast of Xiangzhou District and the middle of Doumen District had higher accessibility, while the educational institutions in the middle and south of Zhuhai City had lower accessibility, and the educational institutions in the middle of Xiangzhou District had the lowest accessibility. (3) Based on accessibility, the service scopes of field environmental education activities in ecological protection zones were divided into 15 blocks. Here, the educational institutions located in Xiangzhou District, the western part of Jinwan District, and western, middle, and eastern parts of Doumen District had relatively strong spatial dispersions with the ecological protection zones within their blocks, while the educational institutions located in the central and eastern parts of Jinwan District and northern and southern parts of Doumen District had relatively weak spatial dispersions with the ecological protection zones within their blocks.},

  abstract = {This study used the two-step floating catchment area method and potential model to calculate facility accessibility and potential service scope of public health infrastructure distribution, and to evaluate its spatial equity. We applied the Gini coefficient to measure the spatial equilibrium at each level of public health infrastructure in Doumen District, Guangdong, China, from different perspectives. The following results were obtained: (1) Significant spatial differences were observed in the accessibility of public health facilities among different levels; the higher the health facility level, the greater the difference in spatial accessibility. Spatial differences in the accessibility of public health infrastructure at the primary level and higher were distributed in a block-like pattern, while spatial differences in the accessibility of rural health stations were distributed in a circular pattern. Administrative villages tended to have the highest and lowest accessibility of tertiary and secondary hospitals, but not of primary hospitals and rural health stations. The frequencies for administrative villages with the highest and lowest accessibility were 32.8\% and 49.6\% of the total number of villages in the district, respectively, for tertiary hospitals; 39.2\% and 48.8\% for secondary hospitals; 19.2\% and 24.8\% for primary hospitals; 16.8\% and 21.6\% for rural health stations. (2) The potential service scope was spatially dissociative for tertiary hospitals, and differed more significantly in terms of space for secondary hospitals; the potential service scope of the two overlapped. The potential service scope of primary hospitals was relatively balanced, with strong spatial continuity, while that of rural health service centers was spatially fragmented. The service scope of rural health service centers was mostly consistent with their respective village-level administrative divisions. (3) The higher the level of public health infrastructure, the less balanced its spatial layout. Conversely, the lower the level of public health infrastructure, the more balanced its spatial layout.},

  abstract = {China’s high-speed rail was inaugurated in 2008; it has greatly improved accessibility, and reduced the time required to travel between cities, but at the same time, has caused an unfair distribution of accessibility levels. Therefore, this paper analyzes urban traffic roads and socio-economic statistics, using network analysis methods, accessibility coefficients of variation, and social demand indexes to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of transport accessibility and spatial equity in China. By 2015, the national transport accessibility level will form a new pattern of “corridors” and “islands”, centered on high-speed rail lines and sites. Additionally, the opening of high-speed railways has improved, to a certain extent, the inter-regional accessibility balance, and increased accessibility from high-speed railway sites to non-site cities. Spatial equality was also analyzed using the accessibility coefficient and social demand index. In conclusion, studying accessibility and spatial equity plays an important role in the rational planning of urban land resources and transportation.},

	abstract = {Place-based accessibility measures communicate the potential interaction with opportunities at a zone that populations can access. Recent research has explored the implications of how opportunities are counted by different accessibility methods. In conventional measures, opportunities are multiply counted if more than one zone offers access to the same opportunity. This multi-count of opportunities leads to values of accessibility that are difficult to interpret. A possible solution to enhance the meaning-making of accessibility results is by constraining the calculations to match a known quantity. This ensures all zonal values sum up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of opportunities). In this way, each value can be meaningfully related to this total. A recent effort that implements this solution is spatial availability, a singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper, we extend spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or more generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability, we proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. We then apply it to an empirical example of low emission zones in Madrid, Spain. We conclude with suggestions for future research and its use in evaluating policy interventions.},

	abstract = {Internal travel distances are fundamental in accessibility measurement, as they affect the weight of the intra-regional interactions, especially when using a gravity formulation. The contribution of the internal accessibility of each zone to its overall accessibility is known as self-potential. Several studies demonstrate its importance in accessibility analyses, especially in the most urbanized regions. It is precisely in urban regions where internal travel distances are more difficult to estimate due to congestion, which in turn may be influenced by factors such as urban density, urban morphology, network infrastructure, etc. Accessibility analyses usually use coarse estimates of internal distances, generally based on the regions' area and in some cases considering its level of urbanization. In this study we explore different forms of estimating internal travel distances in accessibility analysis and reflect on their advantages and drawbacks. One of the main difficulties that arise when measuring internal travel distances is the lack of data. However, the growing potential of {ICTs} in providing new sources of data can be used to improve representativeness of data. In this study we used speed profiles data from {TeleAtlas}/{TomTom} to calculate internal travel distances for European {NUTS}-3 regions and we compare this measure with three other metrics traditionally used in the literature. Following this exercise, we discuss the conditions under which it is advantageous to use more complex measures of internal travel distance. Finally, we test the sensitivity of potential accessibility indicators to the combined effect of different internal distance metrics and distance decay factors.},

	abstract = {Accessibility is a fundamental but often neglected concept in transportation analysis and planning. Three complementary views of accessibility have evolved in the literature. The first is the constraints‐oriented approach, best implemented by Hägerstrand's space‐time prisms. The second perspective follows a spatial interaction framework and derives “attraction‐accessibility measures” that compare destinations' attractiveness with the travel costs required. A third approach measures the benefit provided to individuals by the transportation/land‐use system. This paper reconciles the three complementary approaches by deriving space‐time accessibility and benefit measures that are consistent with the rigorous Weibull axiomatic framework for accessibility measures. This research also develops computational procedures for calculating these measures within network structures. This provides realistic accessibility measures that reflect the locations, distances, and travel velocities allowed by an urban transportation network. Since their computational burdens are reasonable, they can be applied at the urban scale using a {GIS}.},

In this paper, a review is made of various existing theoretical bases, with special emphasis on recent behavioural approaches. It is suggested that this theoretical framework now allows a better appraisal of accessibility indicators and precise recommendations are proposed for their practical formulation and use. Various examples are given, especially for disaggregate analysis where a calculation "for a given person" is proposed instead of the conventional calculation "by a given mode". Finally, the relations between accessibility and trip rate are examined; from a study made in French cities, it is suggested that accessibility is a powerful determinant of trip rate.},

	abstract = {Studies that examine spatial characteristics of urban unemployment are often based on some simplistic measures of employment accessibility. In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},

Such an allocation is usually undertaken with the aid of a production-constrained gravity model, although this type of model ignores the relationship between retail expenditure patterns and spatial competition and agglomeration forces. The effect of such a relationship on urban structure is examined with the aid of a production-constrained competing destinations model in three situations: (1) in a simple facility -location problem, (2) in a Garin-Lowry model, and (3) in the use of catastrophe theory and bifurcation theory to examine urban dynamics. The replacement of the gravity model by the competing destinations model is shown to produce more realistic urban models and leads to new insights into structural dynamics.},

Within such a process the early stages are concerned with explaining the relatively trivial characteristics of the phenomena of interest, and the later stages are devoted to explaining more important behavioural issues. Coleman (1964) calls this approach the 'method of residues', and its power is first demonstrated here by a reinterpretation of the well-known gravity model. An ad hoc test of the method on the Toronto-centred region serves to emphasise the need for a more formal approach, and thus an analogy between the method and the Bayesian viewpoint is introduced. A method of information minimising, more general but consistently and unambiguously related to the method of entropy maximising, is used to make the formal approach operational, and the method is used to generate an 'extended' family of spatialinteraction models. A number of spatial-interaction models are derived, and the paper is concluded by a test of two of these models on the Toronto-centred region.},
