The author presents an operational definition and suggests a method for determining accessibility patterns within metropolitan areas.

The paper concludes that gravity-type accessibility measures generally perform better than other measures. The most commonly used measure, size of opportunity weighted by the reciprocal of distance, is not statistically surpassed by any other measures. Cumulative opportunity within the average commuting distance and the distance to the central business district are the poorest accessibility measures.},

This paper explores the relationship between land use and accessibility through analysis of changing land use covers in the suburban areas of Greater Seattle over a period of 30 years. Two simple interpretations of accessibility are employed. Relative accessibility is used to investigate changes in suburban growth patterns relative to the distance to the metropolitan central business district while integral accessibility reflects the correlation between the pattern of distribution of land uses and the pattern of the regional transportation network. The first model points to a weakening of the impact of the metropolitan core on the distribution of suburban activities. The second model shows a remarkably strong and consistent relationship between patterns of land use development and accessibility to high-class regional roads providing a strong confirmation of the bid- rent model on the micro scale. STANILOV K. (2003) L'accessibilité et l'occupation du sol: étude de cas des banlieues de Seattle de 1960 à 1990, Reg. Studies 37 , 783-794. Par moyen d'une analyse de la variation de l'occupation du sol dans les zones de banlieue de l' agglomération de Seattle sur une période de 30 années, cet article cherche à examiner le rapport entre l'occupation du sol et la notion d'accessibilité. On emploie deux interprétations simples de la notion d'accessibilité. On se sert de la notion d'acessibilité relative afin d'examiner la variation de la distribution de la croissance des banlieues en fonction de la distance au noyau commercial métropolitain, alors que la notion d'accessibilité intégrante reflète la corrélation entre la distribution de l'occupation du sol et celle du réseau de transport régional. Le premier modèle indique un affaiblissement de l'impact du noyau métropolitain sur la distribution des activités de banlieue. Le deuxième modèle montre un rapport fort et régulier entre la distribution de l'occupation du sol et l'accessibilité aux routes régionales de qualité, ce qui vient fortement à l'appui du modèle de location à l'échelle microéconomique.

Dieser Aufsatz untersucht die Beziehung zwischen Landnutzung und Zugänglichkeit in einem Zeitraum von 30 Jahren mittels einer Analyse der Decken sich wandelnder Landnutzung in den Vorortgebieten von Großseattle. Es wurden zwei einfache Interpretationen von Zugänglichkeit benutzt. Relative Zugänglichkeit diente dazu, Verä nderungen in Wachstumsmustern von Vororten in Bezug auf die Entfernung zum großstädtischen Hauptgeschäftsgebiet zu untersuchen, wä hrend integrale Zugänglichkeit die Korrelation zwischen dem Verteilungsmuster von Landnutzungen und dem Muster des regionalen Verkehrsnetzes widerspiegelt. Das erste Modell weist auf ein Nachlassen der Auswirkung des Großstadtkerns auf die Verteilung der Vorortaktivitäten hin. Das zweite Modell zeigt eine bemerkenswert ausgeprägte und beständige Beziehung zwischen Mustern der Entwicklung der Landnutzung und Zugänglichkeit zu erstklassigen Regionalstraßen auf, und stellt damit eine überzeugende Bestä tigung des Angebots-Mietmodells im Mikromaßstab dar.},

First, an overview of accessibility used in urban goods transport is made to motivate the proposed framework. Second, the indicator is presented and justified. Third, the analysis is applied to the current situation for the urban area of Lyon, presenting and discussing the main results.

abstract = {This paper contains an examination of the fundamental assumption underlying the use of accessibility indicators: that an individual's travel behavior is related to his or her location vis-à-vis the distribution of potential activity sites. First, the conceptual and measurement issues surrounding accessibility and its relationship to travel are reviewed; then, an access measure for individuals is formulated. Using data from the Uppsala (Sweden) Household Travel Survey and controlling for sex, automobile availability, and employment status, the authors explore the relationship between both home- and work-based accessibility and five aspects of an individual's travel: mode use, trip frequencies and travel distances for discretionary purposes, trip complexity, travel in conjunction with the journey to work, and size of the activity space. From the results it can be seen that although all of these travel characteristics are related to accessibility to some degree, the travel–accessibility relationship is not as strong as deductive formulations have implied. High accessibility levels are associated with higher proportions of travel by nonmotorized means, lower levels of automobile use, reduced travel distances for certain discretionary trip purposes, and smaller individual activity spaces. Furthermore, the density of activity sites around the workplace affects the distances travelled by employed people for discretionary purposes. Overall, accessibility level has a greater impact on mode use and travel distance than it does on discretionary trip frequency. This result was unexpected in light of the strong trip frequency–accessibility relationship posited frequently in the literature.},

Undertaking accessibility analysis with use of Accessibility Analyst allows the user to take full advantage of a GIS to produce spatial distributions of accessibility over a region.

Of the large number of possible definitions of an Accessibility Index, it goes on to choose the form that statistically explains better the changes in the number of passengers using a station. The methodology followed in order to do this, can be used as a guideline for determining the type of index that would best explain the data in other similar situations. Having selected an Accessibility Index for railway stations, a simple regression model has been made, that connects this accessibility index to the number of passengers using the station. The type of this relation, its statistical characteristics, and its sensitivity are then discussed and some useful overall conclusion reached. The data used and a first application of the results, which is also briefly described in the paper refer to the railway network of Greece.},

abstract = {Accessibility is a useful concept in the study of the spatial structure of a region, if it can be calibrated appropriately. While graph-theoretic analysis has been used widely as a measurement scheme for the nodal accessibility in various transport networks, several limitations have been pointed out in the existing graph-theoretic accessibility measurements. This study proposes a new algorithm for deriving the nodal accessibility measure, as an attempt to improve the conventional graph-theoretic accessibility measurements. Corrections are made in such a way that irrelevant loops are excluded and relevant indirect connection paths are included selectively. In particular, the new algorithm is developed for intraurban subway networks, and includes the characteristics of intraurban subway traffic behavior. The concept of inconvenience of transfer is introduced, which is one of the most influential factors in the intraurban subway traffic. Nodal differentiation is allowed, if the nodes play different roles in the travel behavior and eventually in the accessibility. For this purpose, we employ a weighting procedure, according to which the influence of transfer on a sequence of linkages is taken into account. The new accessibility measurement scheme is then applied to the Seoul subway network. Here GIS techniques are utilized to generate accessibility surfaces from the discrete nodal accessibility values, and the changes in the spatial structure of the nodal accessibility are analyzed. Finally, based on the resulting changes in the spatial structure of accessibility in the subway network, the direction of changes in the land value and the land use pattern in Seoul is discussed.},

Time—space measures of accessibility do not make these assumptions although they are data hungry, retrospective, and share with the other measures the narrow conception of accessibility as a property of the built environment.

The paper is concerned with, firstly, a set of definitions related to the concept of accessibility. A distinction is made between the relative accessibility between two points and the integral, or total, accessibility at a point. Secondly, various operational forms of these definitions are illustrated with reference to the Hamilton, Ontario, urban area. The derivation of the various measures that are developed is discussed.

abstract = {Ex ante evaluations of transport policy options (including infrastructure plans) are generally based on cost-benefit analyses (CBA). Accessibility changes are included in such analyses indirectly, via a utilitarian perspective. But accessibility is broader than is assumed by this perspective and also incorporates equity and related distribution effects as well as social exclusion. This paper aims to give an overview of the relevance of distribution effects and equity, and social exclusion for accessibility, based on the literature. The most important conclusions of our paper is that the two subjects are poorly addressed in transport appraisal in general, and in CBA in particular. Additional ethical theories could add value to the utilitarian perspective, egalitarian theories being a major competitor. Equity analysis is however complex because there are several types of equity, various ways to categorize people for equity analysis, numerous impacts to consider, and various ways of measuring these impacts. And such analysis requires normative judgements, in addition to simply presenting distribution effects. Several options are available to express distribution effects. Important choices to be made if such effects need to be reported relate to the unit of comparison (e.g. the household versus the individual), the indicator to be used, and the value of each unit to be compared (e.g. accessibility) for all units of comparison (e.g. households). We also conclude that CBA is not suitable for evaluating social exclusion policies. Based on this overview we propose an agenda for potential future research in the area of ethics and accessibility.},

Various concepts of attraction, accessibility, and potential are examined with the object of reaching a more satisfactory definition. Multivariate analysis of data relating to an urban area suggests that the influences of conventional accessibility indices are concealed by collinear socioeconomic variations; when these are separated there is a more pronounced relationship. It is shown that such a relationship has important consequences for urban planning.},

We try to improve the interpretability of the results by estimating the separate influence of land-use changes, infrastructure projects, and congestion on the development of job accessibility.

abstract = {Public transportation investment is made primarily because of its potential social and economic benefits. Properly identifying and measuring these benefits has been the central concern in rail transit investment. The social aspects of the benefits, however, have not been well examined. In this research on the potential benefits of Tren Urbano (a new rail transit system proposed in San Juan, Puerto Rico), accessibility measures are utilized as a key analytical tool. An analysis of Tren Urbano’s effects on employment accessibility in the region is presented. The results show that there is a need for lower-income workers to improve their accessibility to jobs. Tren Urbano will enhance employment accessibility at the regional level and for all income groups as well. The results also reveal spatial inequity in the distribution of the potential benefits, even though the eventual outcome will be dependent on the actual distribution of ridership. Efforts should be made to channel the potential benefits of transportation investment toward socially targeted populations. Integrating the rail system with other transit modes and formulating favorable land use policies are critical to enhance accessibility.},

The case study examines the accessibility benefits and related user benefits of intensive mixed-use strategies aimed at increasing the density and diversity of activities around railway stations for the Randstad area of the Netherlands for the 1996–2030 period. A heavy concentration of activities near railway stations is shown to result in decreasing marginal returns for public-transport users and disbenefits for car users.},

abstract = {Accessibility research, within the context of the social exclusion dimensions of transport, has provided valuable tools to understand the potential of people to reach daily life activity locations. In this paper, model-based estimates of distance travelled are used to calculate a cumulative opportunities measure of accessibility. Multivariate, spatially expanded models produce estimates of distance travelled that are specific to both geographical location and type of individual. Opportunity landscapes obtained based on these estimates are used for comparative accessibility analysis by means of what are termed relative accessibility deprivation indicators. The indicators proposed are demonstrated with a case study of food deserts in the city of Montreal, Canada. The results of the analysis illustrate the variations in accessibility between individuals in low-income households and the reference group, and the effect of vehicle ownership for accessibility to food services, thus highlighting the social exclusion implications of these factors.},

abstract = {Studies that examine spatial characteristics of urban unemployment are often based on some simplistic measures of employment accessibility. In this paper a refined methodological framework for measuring accessibility is presented, which enables the researcher (1) to improve the measurement by accounting for job competition among workers commuting by different modes, and (2) to understand the outcome more thoroughly by distinguishing the effect of location from that of workers' auto ownership. This refined framework is applied to a case study of employment accessibility of low-wage workers living in Boston's inner-city neighborhoods, with primarily 1990 Census demographic and journey-to-work data. The empirical results show clearly that, although the central location of inner-city residence still gives the low-wage workers some advantage, auto ownership is the more important determinant. Low-wage workers living in inner-city neighborhoods on average do not have high employment accessibility because a large percentage of them do not own any motor vehicle and hence have limited spatial mobility. Implications of the findings are discussed and qualified in light of the limitation of the research.},
